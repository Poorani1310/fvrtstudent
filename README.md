This application is used to get comfortable with Routes in React and useContext Hook to maintain a state across the siblings.

This App lists students in the main page and allow to add the student to the Favourite list.

Once the student is added to the favourite list, the app wont allow to add it again and the button will be disabled.

The list of student added to the favourites can be listed in another page by clicking the button View Favourites.

If there are no student in the favourites list then the system displays no students were added.
